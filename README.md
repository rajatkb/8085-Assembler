# 8085-Assembler-
Its a 8085 assembler . Build for educational purpose  

### work in progress :
#### checklist  
1. add all intructions
2. finish the jump
3. create a VM for executing and getting results  

<b>Note:</b> It does not uses lex , yac , bison etc and also this is not made while keeping in mind about LALR or resursive parsers.  
I made it as it suited for the purpose. Since it was my class assignment and i thought to make somthing usefull out of it hence did all those stuff by myself. Used C++ because its gives awesome but costly string manipulation. C_string is fine but the segfaults gets on my nerves, to much to manage. Also this is not how you should make parsers or compiler front end in general.

A simple implementation of a lexer and parser for parsing and generating code for 8085 in debug mode.
